# OOP-Project: XML Parser
This is my project for Object Oriented Programming course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics at Sofia University 'St.Kliment Ohridski'.

 The goal of the project is to create a program that creates a suitable tree representation of data in memory.

 The XML file can be processed with basic operations such as open, close, save, save as, set, newChild, etc.  simple XPATH 2.0 queries are also supported.
